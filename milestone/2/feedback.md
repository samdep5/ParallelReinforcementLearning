# High-level description feedback

Cool project idea!

It would be interesting to see how well communication latencies can be hidden in
that problem.  You do not specify how frequent you need to synchronize among
agents, it will be a parameter of how well the problem can be parallelized.  If
you can introduce an approximation to reduce the communication frequency and
thereby improve parallel performance would be cool.

Looking forward to your next results.
